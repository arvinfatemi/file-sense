Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Machine Learning Engineer position at AI Innovations Inc. With over 5 years of experience in software engineering and a strong focus on machine learning systems, I believe I would be an excellent fit for your team.

In my current role at Tech Corp, I have led the development of ML-powered recommendation systems that serve millions of users daily. I have extensive experience with TensorFlow, PyTorch, and production ML infrastructure on AWS and GCP.

I am particularly excited about your company's work in natural language processing and computer vision. My thesis work at MIT focused on transformer architectures for NLP tasks, and I have continued to stay at the forefront of AI research.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience align with your needs.

Sincerely,
John Doe
